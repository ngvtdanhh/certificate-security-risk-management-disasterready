# 🚨 Incident Escalation Guidelines

## 🧭 Purpose

Define a structured approach to escalate security incidents based on severity, impact, and urgency within humanitarian contexts.

## 🔢 Severity Levels

| Level | Description                       | Example                                     |
|-------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Low – No operational impact       | Phishing attempt blocked                    |
| 2     | Medium – Localized interruption   | Data leakage from misconfigured S3 bucket   |
| 3     | High – Organization-wide impact   | Ransomware affecting core services          |

## 📈 Escalation Flow

1. **Detect → Classify → Contain**
2. Notify Tier 1 responders (IT/Security Officer)
3. If Level 2+, escalate to:
   - Country Director
   - Data Protection Officer
4. If Level 3:
   - Trigger incident response plan
   - Notify donors or affected partners

## 🔐 Roles & Responsibilities

- **IT Officer**: First responder, containment
- **Legal/Data Officer**: Regulatory coordination
- **Country Director**: Crisis command decisions
