# 🧪 Security Risk Simulation – Field Deployment Scenario

This demo simulates a basic risk assessment and mitigation strategy for a humanitarian deployment in a politically unstable region.

---

## 🌍 Scenario Context

- **Location**: Region with recent unrest and active militia presence
- **Team**: 5 humanitarian workers including 2 foreigners
- **Assets**: Vehicles, sensitive medical data, communication devices
- **Mission**: Provide mobile medical services for displaced populations

## ⚠️ Step 1: Threat Identification

| Threat Type        | Description                              | Source            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Armed Conflict     | Clashes between militias and government  | External (Human)  |
| Roadblock/Kidnapping | Targeted attacks on NGOs               | External (Intentional) |
| Disease Exposure   | Cholera outbreak risk                    | Environmental     |

---

## 🛡️ Step 2: Vulnerability Analysis

| Asset Affected      | Vulnerability                             | Exposure Level |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Medical Team        | Lack of body armor or threat awareness    | High           |
| Route to Clinics    | Poor GPS coverage & unverified roads      | Medium         |
| Data Transmission   | Weak encryption protocols used            | High           |

---

## 🧮 Step 3: Risk Matrix (Impact × Likelihood)

| Threat                | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Rating |
|-----------------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Armed Conflict        | High       | High   | **Extreme** |
| Kidnapping            | Medium     | High   | **High**    |
| Disease Exposure      | Medium     | Medium | Moderate    |

---

## 🔧 Step 4: Mitigation Actions

- **Armed Conflict**:
  - Avoid known militia zones via intelligence briefings
  - Use low-profile vehicles, remove NGO logos
  - Establish daily check-in protocols

- **Kidnapping**:
  - Hire vetted local security escort
  - Pre-arranged extraction plan with embassy contact

- **Data Breach**:
  - Encrypt devices (AES-256)
  - Use satellite communication with VPN

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- [HEAT Training Simulation Tools](https://gisf.ngo) – for threat mapping and situational drills
- Secure Communications Toolkit (e.g., Signal, Silent Phone)
- Crisis24 for real-time threat intel

---

## 📝 Outcome Review

- All risks reduced from *Extreme/High* to *Moderate* with mitigation in place
- Demonstrates importance of **context-driven** and **people-centered** risk planning

## 💬 Final Note

> In volatile zones, proactive simulation improves real-world preparedness and protects both humanitarian workers and affected populations.
